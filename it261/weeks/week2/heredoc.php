My favorite book is $book, written by $author, and is presently 
a miniseries on HULU. Hulu's viewing audience is extremely excited about 
the miniseries and looks forward to the 5th season of the award-winning 
"$book!"

$actor's rendition as $character is right on! Once this content is corrected 
with "escapes" and nesting my variables inside '.    .' it will display 
properly; my content is displayed in red (not orange), and my variables are 
displayed in black!!!
